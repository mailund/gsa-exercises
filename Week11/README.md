# Genome-scale Algorithms Week 11 â€” exercises

## Project 4

Hand in project 4. At the exercises we will discuss the results as described in the project description.

## Final Project (Project 5)

Take a look at the setup of the test and evaluations scripts. Make sure that you can get it to work.

## Approximative matching and CIGARs

In the slides presented at the lecture (and at the exercises last week), we saw how to use a suffix-tree or BW-search for finding all occurrences of a pattern within a given edit distance. How do you extend these methods to also output the CIGAR strings of these matches?
